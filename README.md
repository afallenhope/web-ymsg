## PHP YMSG Protocol Example
This is a very basic skeleton project for the YMSG protocol written in PHP.
Initially I've written this in VB.NET then ported it to C# and now PHP. 

## Functionality
At this given time there's no "real" functionality aside from signing into YMSG and then notifying a user and then signing off.

## Examples
Initially you can look a the test.php

## Future Enhancements
Although this is a dead project and I'm not using it much, I'd like to add features. Currently, I'm using a "half-arsed" MVC style..  Model being the client, the view being the templates (located in views/) and Controller being your test page... So really it's just MV . I'd like to add the option as a "plugin system" where you can dynamically add/remove plugins and restart the bot. 

## The future is near!
Although it's a "new" project it's simply for leisure, if you find it useful please fork it include a directory /.contact and your contact details and I'd love to add that as part of the project!
